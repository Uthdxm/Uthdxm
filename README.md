# Khun Uthdam - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Uthdam! I am on track to completing my degree in Digital Business. I am passionate about using data to uncover meaningful insights for business. I am excited to bring my soft skill,technical, and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
